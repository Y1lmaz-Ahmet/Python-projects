# Number Guessing Game

## Objectives
- Implement a simple number guessing game in Python.
- Include an ASCII art logo for a personalized touch.
- Allow users to choose between 'easy' and 'hard' difficulty modes.
- Provide feedback on the user's guesses and display remaining attempts.
- End the game when the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script (`guess-the-number.py`).
2. Follow the instructions to choose the game difficulty ('easy' or 'hard').
3. Input your guesses when prompted and receive feedback.
4. The game ends when you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Implementation Details
- The game includes an ASCII art logo for a visually appealing start.
- The difficulty level determines the number of attempts allowed ('easy' has 10 attempts, 'hard' has 5).
- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated for the user to guess.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
